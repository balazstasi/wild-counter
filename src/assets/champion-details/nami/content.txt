Paragraphs:
Switch between Dark and Light themes

Launches a stream that bounces 3 times between allied and enemy champions, healing allies for 55 / 85 / 115 / 145 (+30% AP) and dealing 65 / 120 / 175 / 230 (+50% AP) magic damage to enemies.

Can hit each target once. Healing and damage values are modified by -15% (+7.5% AP) each bounce.

Sends a wave, dealing 150 / 250 / 350 (+60% AP) magic damage, knocking up for 0.5 seconds and slowing by 50% / 60% / 70%.

Slow lasts for 2 - 4 seconds, increasing with how far the wave travels.

Allies touched gain double the effect from Surging Tides.

Nami is an enchanter Support Champion. She has great crowd control and excels at healing and buffing your team to help keep them alive. She has a pretty strong laning phase, you just need to be careful if the enemy engages onto you because you do not have a lot of health and can die quickly. The later the game goes, the better Nami gets. Her heals become even stronger and you can do a lot more to keep your team alive with her Tidal Wave and her other abilities that lock down the enemies.

Nami does best with support items that give her heals more power. Imperial Mandate is a unique item for Nami. Since Nami has so many abilities to impair enemies' movement, she can do additional damage to help throughout the game. Another strong item is Harmonic Echo. Since Nami's heals are on a low cooldown she can use Harmonic Echo to heal her team up even more than before.

With runes, we have the following:

This gives Nami's heal an extra shield and also allows her to deal that little bit of additional damage, which is excellent for early-game trades in the laning phase.

Scorch gives Nami a lot of poking power in the early game when using Ebb and Flow on enemy champions.

Nami wants to play aggressive during the laning phase, using her Ebb and Flow and Tidecaller's Blessing, which work well with Empowered Attacks' bonus auto attack damage.

Eyeball Collector is great since it gives Nami more Ability Power every time she gets a takedown. Zombie Ward can also be a good choice if you often roam and look to kill wards.

Since Nami is a very squishy champion that can help keep her team alive. The enemy team will look to focus you to try and take you down early. However with Bone Plating you will take less damage.

For summoner spells, Flash is a must on most champions. It's a great spell to get you out of a bad situation or allows you to flash and save your ally or even maybe get a kill. Ignite is a great 2nd summoner spell for Nami as you want to look to take aggressive trades in the early game because of your high damage output.

Nami does ok in the early game, you can poke the enemy with Ebb and Flow and it can bounce back to you and heal you at the same time. You can heal your AD carry if they are low on HP so you can survive and stay in lane longer. You can always look for an Aqua Prison bubble on the enemy and if you land it you can follow up with your AD to do a lot of damage to the enemy. You have to be very careful when stepping forward as if you get caught out and engaged on you can die very quickly.

The later the game goes the stronger Nami gets as her shields and heals get stronger with more items. You can use your Tidal Wave to engage on the enemies but make sure you always stay back and heal your team. It is really important as a support that you stay with your team and help them during team fights. Prioritize staying back and keeping your carries alive protecting them against the enemy team using everything possible to keep them alive. The AD Carry in your team is one of the main damage sources and keeping he/her alive is really important!

Nami is quite an easy champion to play but does have some skill shots that you need to practice to utilize them best! She is great at keeping your team alive and can pressure a lot in the laning phase to give your Dragon Lane partner a lot of breathing space.

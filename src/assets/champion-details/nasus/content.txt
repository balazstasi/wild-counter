Nasus is a top-lane fighter. He really struggles in the early game but once you reach the late game and have a lot of stacks from Siphoning Strike, you have the potential to one-shot enemies. The way you get stacks from Siphoning Strike is by using the ability to last hit minions. This is the most important thing with Nasus and you must do this to help yourself win the game. Once you reach the late game you can 1 vs 1 a lot of champions and take down towers really quickly.

Nasus uses a mixture of both damage and tank items that work well with her kit. Trinity Force is a great first item for Nasus. This item gives him both damage and tank stats. Trinity's passive effect, Spellblade, also work great with Nasus' abilities, especially Siphoning Strike. Another item that works great with Siphoning Strike is Sundered Sky. This item guarantees that you'll be able to crit and deal bonus damage.

For runes, we have the following:

As Nasus, you'll suffer in the early game while farming and getting stacks with Siphoning Strike. Fleet Footwork will help you sustain and deal more damage in the late game.

Great for when Nasus drops low on health when he goes in to try and kill the enemy. It can save you and bait the enemy into thinking you are already dead.

Second Wind helps Nasus a lot, especially during the laning phase. It allows him to take short trades, and when he backs off, he heals up to stay in the lane longer.

When Nasus is farming, he'll be able to gain free health throughout the game, making him difficult to kill

With Spirit Fire being an easy ability to hit Nasus can stack Manaflow Band with ease giving him more mana which helps a lot as the game goes on.

For summoner spells, Flash is a must on most champions. It's a great spell to get out of a situation or if you are trying to go in for the killing blow. For the 2nd spell, it's best to go for Ignite. This helps a lot when going into fights and trying to get that extra damage to kill off the enemies.

Nasus struggles a lot in the early game. You need to make sure you play passive in the early game unless you have a great opportunity to go in if the enemies makes a mistake. In the laning phase, you want to stack your Siphoning Strike as much as possible on every minion. If you get poked early on, you have an inbuilt physical vamp with Soul Eater that can help you heal up. Nasus can also poke back a bit with Spirit Fire.

Once you get to the late game and you have your core items plus plenty of stacks with Siphoning Strike, you can start to fight and become unstoppable. At this stage of the game, the best thing you can do is split-push, this means going to one of the side lanes (top or bottom) and pushing the minions. Nasus' 1 vs 1 potential is really good because of his kit and he pushes towers really fast. When it comes to a 5 vs 5 team fight, your main goal is to get on top of the enemy backline! Use your Wither on the enemy carry to reduce their attack speed and movement speed and use Fury of The Sands to stay alive.

Overall Nasus is a very easy champion to play. If you are ok with farming in the early game and want to run down in the late game and be able to one-shot any champion then Nasus is the best champion for you.

Poppy throws her buckler that bounces off the target. Poppy can pick it up to gain a temporary shield.

Poppy swings her hammer, dealing damage and creating a zone that will slow enemies and explode after a delay.

Poppy passively gains armor and magic resist. This bonus increases when she is low on health. Poppy can activate Steadfast Presence to gain movement speed and stop enemy dashes around her. If a dash is stopped, the enemy is slowed and grounded.

Poppy channels a hammer strike that knocks enemies very far away.

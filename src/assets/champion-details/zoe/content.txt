Paragraphs:
Switch between Dark and Light themes

After using an Ability, Zoe's next Attack deals an additional 20 (+20% AP) magic damage.

More Sparkles! deals damage instantly, and deals 50% damage to structures.

Zoe fires a star that deals increasing damage the further it travels to the first enemy hit dealing between 30 / 65 / 100 / 135 (+60% AP) and 75 / 162.5 / 250 / 337.5 (+150% AP) magic damage. Enemies surrounding the target take 80% damage.

Zoe can recast this Ability to redirect the missile to a new position near Zoe.

Passive: Enemies drop spell shards when casting a Spell or using a Boot Enchantment. Specific minions also drop a spell shards when Zoe, or a nearby ally, kills them. Zoe can pick up this shard to cast that ability once.

Passive: When Zoe casts this Ability or any Spell, she gains 25% / 30% / 35% / 40% Movement Speed for 2 seconds and tosses 3 missiles at the target she Attacked most recently. These missiles deal 25 / 35 / 45 / 55 (+15% AP) magic damage each.

Active: Cast the Ability from a spell shard Zoe has picked up

Spell shards last on the ground for 20 seconds. Each missile can apply More Sparkles!

Zoe dropkicks a bubble that deals 30 / 80 / 130 / 180 (+50% AP) magic damage, lingering as a trap if it doesn't hit anything. The bubble's range is extended when flying over terrain.

After a delay, the victim falls Asleep for 2 seconds. Attacks and Ability hits wake them up, dealing 30 / 80 / 130 / 180 (+50% AP) bonus true damage.

Before the target falls Asleep, they are Drowsy, becoming increasingly slowed (up to 15% / 20% / 25% / 30%).

Zoe is an AP mage. She is a mid-lane champion that uses her abilities to wave clear minions, sleep and burst enemies with one smooth combo. Zoe excels at catching enemies alone, dealing single-target damage with her Sleepy Trouble Bubble followed by Paddle Star to deal a lot of damage! When playing Zoe, it's best to play safe in the early game. Wave clear minions and try to take trades when you get summoner spells or boots enchants from Spell Thief. Once the laning phase is almost over, you will have access to Zoe's ultimate, Portal Jump. When Zoe gets her ultimate, she can look to roam around the map, land a long-range Sleepy Trouble Bubble and land a long-range Paddle Star with the help of Portal Jump.

After using an ability, Zoe's next attack deals additional magic damage. This can be used to clear waves very quickly. When using Paddle Star, make sure to auto-attack in between the 1st and 2nd cast of the ability. This will give you two empowered auto attacks with one use of Paddle Star.

Zoe fires a star that deals increasing damage the further it travels to the first enemy hit dealing magic damage. Enemies surrounding the target also take reduced magic damage.

I highly recommend manual aiming this ability as sometimes auto casting can aim this ability in the wrong direction. You can also combo Paddle Star with Portal Jump and/or Flash to extend the range and increase the damage of Paddle Star.

Enemies drop spell shards when casting a Spell or using a Boot Enchantment. This will drop a Shard on the floor that you can pick up and then use by pressing Spell Thief. Specific minions also drop a spell shard when Zoe or a nearby ally kills them.

When Zoe casts this Ability or any Summoner Spell, she gains movement speed (increased if it's a Summoner Spell because of Nimbus Cloak) and tosses a few missiles at the target she attacked most recently.

Zoe dropkicks a bubble that deals magic damage; if this ability doesn't hit a target, it lingers as a trap. The bubble range is extended and will fly over any terrain until it ends. You can use this to your advantage to land a long-range bubble and then use Portal Jump to jump over the terrain to deal a lot of damage with your Paddle Star.

When Sleepy Trouble Bubble hits an enemy, the victim falls asleep for a few seconds after a delay. Attacks and ability hits wake up the target, dealing bonus damage. It's essential to not auto-attack targets that are asleep and instead try to land Paddle Star on that target so your ability can deal more damage.

Zoe teleports to a nearby position for a second. Afterwards, she teleports back. Zoe can use abilities and auto attacks but can't move when you use the ability. Portal Jump can be used to get vision around major objectives (Dragon and Baron); however, you need to be careful as you can take a lot of damage and potentially put yourself in a difficult situation.

Zoe does excellently with most ability-power items. Her primary source of damage is from all her abilities. Lich Bane is a unique item for Zoe. This item synergizes incredibly well with Zoe's More Sparkles. Every time Zoe uses an ability, her next auto attack will be doing a lot of damage. Rabadon's Deathcap is another excellent item for Zoe, increasing her overall ability power giving her a lot of burst damage.

With runes, we have the following:

Thanks to Zoe's incredible range and catch potential with Sleepy Trouble Bubble she can use First Strike very well and do a lot of damage.

Zoe's Ultimate Portal Jump counts as a dash, meaning Zoe will get Magic Penetration when using her Ultimate. When comboing her Ultimate with Paddle Star, Zoe can do a lot of damage.

We already have incredible synergy with auto attacks from Zoe's Passive and Lich Bane, and with Empowered Attack, the next auto attack after using an ability will be doing a lot of damage.

Eyeball Collector is great since it gives Zoe more Ability Power every time she gets a takedown. Zombie Ward can also be a good choice if you often roam and look to kill wards.

Since Zoe is a very squishy champion that tends to get focused, Bone Plating will help her take reduced damage from the first three instances of damage, which will help her survive against burst damage.

For summoner spells, Flash is a must on Zoe. It's an excellent spell for getting out of tricky situations and when you're trying to kill enemies. You can also combo Flash with Paddle Star to increase the range so you can deal more damage! Ignite is also a great spell for Zoe since she can use it when she hits her Sleepy Trouble Bubble on an enemy to deal extra damage.

Zoe does well in the early game. She has excellent wave clear with her Paddle Star. When she has cleared the minion wave and her minions are pushed under the enemy tower, she can use this free time to roam around the map to try and get an advantage elsewhere. In the laning phase, you always want to look to try and use her Sleepy Trouble Bubble on the enemies and follow it up with her Paddle Star and Auto attack to deal damage and proc Electrocute.

Zoe is a very versatile champion in the late game because she can fill multiple roles. She can sit in bushes and catch enemies off guard with her Sleepy Trouble Bubble and combo that with other abilities to deal a lot of damage, or she can group with her team and start a fight. When Zoe is grouped with her team, it's best to stay at the back where she can use her abilities to do damage to the enemies and protect her allies; however, you can look to try and hug the terrain and catch an important backline target to try, and one shot them with your abilities.

Overall, Zoe is a great champion that anyone can pick up. She is an easy champion to play but a tough champion to master. She has a fun playstyle; you can play safe or look to take a risk and one-shot a high-value target.

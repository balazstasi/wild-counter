Paragraphs:
Switch between Dark and Light themes

Passive: Gains 8 Armor (25% / 30% / 35% / 40% Armor).

The first attack is empowered to deal 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 (+40% AP +40% Armor) bonus physical damage to the target.

Malphite is a tank top lane champion. As long as Malphite can survive the early game and farm up to get his core items, he can really be a game-changer in the late game with his ultimate, Unstoppable Force. When he groups up in the mid and late game with his team, this is really where Malphite can carry the game and be a big front-line tank that allows the rest of his team to walk up and damage the enemies.

Malphite is a solo front-line tank that can survive a lot of damage, and that reflects in his build. Iceborn Gauntlet is a core item for Malphite. It gives you amazing base stats and the passive helps you push minion waves and slow multiple enemies during a team fight so you can stick to them and deal more damage. Thornmail helps Iceborn Gauntlet have more area of effect and makes it extremely difficult to kill Malphite.

For runes we have:

With Malphite's passive, you can walk up with the shield, take trades, and fight the enemy to allow you to stack Grasp easily to get more health and become unkillable.

Nullifying Orb is the best option here for this row, as the other two don't have much benefit.

Second Wind helps Malphite during the laning phase when he takes a lot of damage, which is the part of the game he struggles with the most.

Overgrowth allows Malphite to gain permanent health throughout the game when nearby minions or monsters are killed. So the more Malphite farms, pushes the lane and kills minions, the more Maximum Health he will get.

With Seismic Shard being an easy point and click spell to hit the enemies it's really easy to get stack on this rune to gain more mana which helps a lot as the game goes on.

For summoner spells, Flash is a must on most champions. It's a great spell to get you out of a bad situation or allows you to flash and save your ally or even maybe get a kill. The 2nd spell is Ignite, this is great on Malphite to get that extra bit of damage. If you poke the enemy early with Seismic Shard you can look to engage onto the enemy at level 5 when you get your ultimate, Unstoppable Force, to try and kill them.

Malphite doesn't do the best in the early game as a tank but as mentioned before it's best to stay back, farm up and poke down the enemy with your Seismic Shard. When you get close to the enemy and start to fight you want to make sure to use Ground Slam to reduce their attack speed. This will help a lot when fighting early on. Once you reach Level 5 and get Unstoppable Force, you can look for a solo kill on the enemy top lane if they are low or save it and roam down to Dragon when it spawns at 4 minutes and group up with your team to get a big game-changing ultimate on the enemy team.

The later the game goes, the tankier and stronger Malphite will get! Not only do you have a great team fight Ultimate that can change the game but you also are really tanky and unkillable at this point of the game that you can walk up and take all the damage whilst your team is doing all the damage to them. You want to stay with your team at all times and try not to get caught out by yourself. You don't do well at all in a 1 vs 1 situation.

With Malphite being one of the only full tank options in the game right now he is really safe and really easy to play. If you like to have an Ultimate that can change and win you the game in an instant whilst also being a big front line tank then Malphite is the go-to champion for you.

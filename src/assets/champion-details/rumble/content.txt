Every ability Rumble casts generates Heat. While above 50 Heat, Rumble enters the Danger Zone, causing his basic abilities to gain bonus effects. When he reaches 150 Heat, he becomes Overheated for 4 seconds.

Overheated: Silences himself, but gains 55% bonus Attack Speed and empowers his attacks to deal additional 5 (+20% AP) magic damage plus 5% of the marget's max Health.

Percent damage is limited to 65 - 150 on monsters.

Ignites his flamethrower, dealing 150 / 190 / 230 / 270 (+110% AP) plus 6% / 8% / 10% / 12% of the target's max Health as magic damage over 3 seconds. The flamethrower deals 105% of this damage against minions.

Danger Zone: Deals 225 / 285 / 345 / 405 (+165% AP) plus 9% of the target's max Health as magic damage instead.

Percent damage is limited to 65 - 150 damage on monsters.

Hitting an enemy who is already slowed by Electro Harpoon increases the slow to 45% / 52.5% / 60% / 67.5% and Magic Resist reduction to 12% / 18% / 24% / 30%.
